- ✅ Separation between administrative roles (Repository Admin, Team Admin) and contributor roles (Project Owner, Team Maintainer)
- ✅ Financial approvals separated from technical approvals for proper governance

**Alignment**: Exceeds industry standards by defining additional specialized roles (Team Admin, Financial Approver) beyond GitHub's built-in roles.

### Team Organization

**Industry Best Practice**: Structure teams to reflect organizational hierarchy while enabling cross-team collaboration.

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ [Team hierarchy](./01-github-governance-roles.md#team-types) reflects organizational structure (Division, Department)
- ✅ [Role-based Teams](./01-github-governance-roles.md#role-based-team) enable cross-organizational functional collaboration
- ✅ [Project Teams](./01-github-governance-roles.md#project-team) facilitate collaboration across division boundaries
- ✅ Standardized [team naming conventions](./03-github-provisioning.md#team-naming-convention) for consistency

**Alignment**: Exceeds industry standards with multi-level team structure and role-based teams that balance organizational hierarchy with collaborative needs.

## Security Practice Assessment

- ✅ Required [documentation files](./09-github-documentation-standards.md#required-documentation-files) (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS)
- ✅ Standardized [templates](./templates/) for common files
- ✅ Clear [documentation standards](./09-github-documentation-standards.md#markdown-standards) with examples

**Alignment**: Strong alignment with documentation best practices, providing comprehensive templates and requirements.

### Contribution Workflows

**Industry Best Practice**: Define clear contribution processes with appropriate reviews and feedback.

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ Defined pull request process with required reviews
- ✅ CODEOWNERS implementation for appropriate reviewer assignment
- ✅ Branch protection ensuring quality checks pass
- ✅ Clear documentation of [contributor responsibilities](./09-github-documentation-standards.md#documentation-roles-and-responsibilities)

**Alignment**: Strong alignment with code review and contribution best practices.

## Integration and Automation Assessment

### Process Automation

**Industry Best Practice**: Automate routine governance and approval processes.

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ [ServiceNow integration](./06-github-servicenow.md) for all GitHub-related requests
- ✅ Standardized [approval workflows](./06-github-servicenow.md#repository-request-approval-workflow) for repository creation and access
- ✅ Automated team assignment based on [HR system attributes](./03-github-provisioning.md#attribute-mapping-strategy)
- ✅ [Repository conversion workflows](./06-github-servicenow.md#repository-conversion-request-flow) for platform migrations

**Alignment**: Strong alignment with enterprise IT service management practices, going beyond basic GitHub functionality.

### Platform Integration

**Industry Best Practice**: Integrate GitHub with other development and operational tools.

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ Integration with HR systems for user provisioning
- ✅ ServiceNow integration for request management
- ✅ Clear [platform selection guidelines](./07-platform-selection-guidelines.md) for GitHub vs Azure DevOps
- ✅ Guidelines for CI/CD implementation through status checks

**Alignment**: Strong alignment with enterprise integration needs, particularly with HR and service management systems.

## Collaboration Model Assessment

### Internal Collaboration

**Industry Best Practice**: Enable seamless collaboration across teams while maintaining proper access controls.

**Our Implementation**:
- ✅ [Multi-level team structure](./01-github-governance-roles.md#role-relationships-and-access-model) with appropriate permissions
- ✅ Cross-divisional [collaboration mechanisms](./04-github-repository-governance.md#cross-divisional-collaboration) through Project Teams
- ✅ Role-based Teams for functional collaboration
- ✅ Clear documentation of team purposes and membership criteria

**Alignment**: Strong alignment with collaboration best practices, with multiple team types to support different collaboration patterns.

### External Collaboration
