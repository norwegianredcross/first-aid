## How we use GitHub in Norwegian Red Cross

The Norwegian Red Cross GitHub organization follows a structured governance framework that ensures secure, efficient, and consistent use of GitHub across the organization. Here's a quick overview:

### Organization Structure
- Hierarchical team structure (Division → Department → Role-based → Project teams)
- Automated user provisioning through HR systems and Okta
- Clear separation between internal users and external collaborators

### Key Roles
- Organization Owners: Manage enterprise settings and billing
- Repository Admins: Handle repository governance and security
- Team Admins: Manage team structures and memberships
- Project Owners: Responsible for specific repositories
- Team Maintainers: Manage team memberships and activities

### Repository Management
- Standardized naming conventions
- Required documentation (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODEOWNERS)
- Security standards including branch protection and secret scanning
- ServiceNow integration for access requests and approvals
